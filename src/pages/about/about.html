<p>Hello, 

Welcome to the Sitting TO Prevent constipation ( STOP Constipation) mobile application. The goal of this mobile application is to utilize mobile technology in reinforcing toilet sitting behavior in order to effectively treat constipation.  There is excellent research to show that behavioral interventions will work to improve outcome from constipation.  To demonstrate that, we have to explain constipation in detail.  

Constipation occurs when the poop spends too long a period of time in the body, making it very hard.  Oftentimes, people with constipation will have some small pellets that are hard and break off the end of the poop, occasionally they will have a hard clay like sandy poop come out and frequently they will have extremely large poop that may even clog the toilet!!.   It is this hard poop that is the problem, and if we can prevent that, then we will go far in treating the signs, symptoms and discomfort associated with constipation.  

Physicians will frequently prescribe stool softeners, which soften the stool, however, the  problem is that stool softeners alone will not solve the problem.  The real problem for many patients with constipation is that they aren’t listening to their body when they have to poop.   Many patients will not even sense that they need to have a bowel movement until the size is that large. Oftentimes, due to years of having large amounts of stool in the GI tract, patients will have an enlarged colon and have a difficult time sensing when there is poop in there.  By the time they feel it, they will have a large, hard bowel movement. 

The most effective way to treat constipation in most patients is to train them to go to the bathroom on a schedule.  In addition to stool softeners prescribed by your doctor, we recommend that you sit on the toilet for 5-10 minutes twice per day.  This should be at the same time each day and we recommend after a meal like breakfast or dinner.  It is okay if the patient does not have a bowel movement, the act of sitting and trying is important.  If no poop after 5-10 minutes, just try again later. It is important that both fleet are on a flat surface like a stool or phone book in order to help generate push.  Additional tricks that work include blowing on a pinwheel or noisemaker to help the body generate a push.  
We have to make sitting on the toilet and pooping a habit.  By training a person to make a habit of daily toilet sitting and by practicing that effort, the person may be able to achieve regularity and put problems with constipation BEHIND them.
