HOW TO USE THE APP: BASICS
The STOP Constipation App is designed to help you practice sitting on the toilet on a regular basis, helping you poop on a more regular basis.  
<ol>
	<li>Set Reminders: Set times for reminders to sit on the toilet and push for poop.  Sitting after mealtimes makes use of the gastrocolic reflex which enables you to poop better after eating. </li>
	<ul>
		<li>For Example: If you eat breakfast at 7 AM and Dinner at 6:30 PM you can set reminders to sit at these times.  </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Set timer: You can set a timer for how long you sit on the toilet.  Can be anywhere from between 1 minute and 10 minutes.</li> 
	<li>Each day, when you receive the reminder to go sit on the toilet, you will be asked a series of questions:</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>Did you take your stool softener</li>
		<li>Did you sit on the toilet</li>
		<li>Did you produce stool</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If the answer is no, you will register a smiley face on the calendar, and a message reminding you that the act of sitting is important and that the more you try to sit the stronger the colon gets</li>
			<li>If the answer is yes, you will be asked to describe the stool.  Patients will be able to slowly determine if their stools are going from a constipated form to a more regular form</li>
			<li>If your answer is yes, you will receive a star (or poop emoji) on the calendar and an encouragement message, way to go.  Regular sitting is the key to having you go to the bathroom regularly.  Keep it up!</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ol>
